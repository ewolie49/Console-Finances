# Console-Finances

In this task we were asked to create a JS code to calculate some finances given an array containing Numbers and Dates.
This is a good exercise to put in practice some of the JS learnt during week four of the course and also to continue doing research on the internet.

When I initially read the instructions I thought this was going to be an easy task, however, it has not been the case and it has taken more time and required more investigation than previous challenges.

While working on this test, I accidentally created breakpoints and hence I thought my code was constantly broken. My TA pointed that out to me and I am now aware of this functionallity.


## Usage

To see the code working you will have to open the console within the inspector.

## Credits
There has been quite a lot of research done for this project as well as working collaborativelly with other students during class hours.
